1. **History of Entity Framework on ASP.NET:** Entity Framework (EF), an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for ADO.NET, was initially part of the .NET Framework. However, starting with EF version 6.0, it has been separately delivered. The inaugural version of EF was released in August 2008, bundled with .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1.

2. **ORM or Object Relational Mapping:** ORM is a programming paradigm that facilitates data conversion between incompatible systems via object-oriented programming languages. In the EF context, developers can manipulate data as domain-specific objects and properties, abstracting away the underlying database tables and columns.

3. **Concept of Entity Framework:** EF is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications, endorsed by Microsoft. It allows developers to interact with data as objects of domain-specific classes, without concerning themselves with the underlying database tables and columns.

4. **Advantages of Entity Framework:** EF enhances developer productivity by enabling data manipulation using objects of domain-specific classes, abstracting the underlying database tables and columns. It obviates the need for most of the data-access code that developers typically have to write.

5. **Disadvantages of Entity Framework:** EF has a few drawbacks, including lazy loading, complex syntax, and the logical schema's inability to comprehend business entities and their relationships.

6. **What is Asp.net?:** ASP.NET is an open-source web framework developed by Microsoft for building modern web apps and services with .NET. ASP.NET is cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.

7. **Structural coding and use from Entity Framework:** In ASP.NET, EF is employed to interact with the database using model classes, which correspond to database tables. Instances of these classes represent records in the tables. EF enables developers to query the database using LINQ, subsequently translating these queries into SQL.

8. **Detailed examination of Entity Framework on Asp.net:** A comprehensive exploration of EF on ASP.NET would entail understanding its components such as DbContext, DbSet, Migrations, and how it facilitates database operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) through code.

9. **LINQ on Entity Framework:** LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is utilized in EF to write queries against the database. These queries, written in C#, are type-safe and easier to write and maintain compared to raw SQL queries.

10. **Key components of Entity Framework:** The key components of EF encompass the Entity Data Model (EDM), LINQ to Entities, Entity SQL, Object Services Layer, Entity Client Data Provider, and ADO.NET Data Provider.

11. **Entity Framework architecture:** The architecture of EF comprises components like the Conceptual Model, Storage Model, Mapping, LINQ to Entities, Entity SQL, Object Service, Entity Client Data Provider, and ADO.NET Data Provider.
